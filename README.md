# rileaf2

This is a small app that quickly finds the area of a leaf sample from an image. We take images of plants in a 3D printed clip with known dimensions.

Conveniently, the clip slots directly into the licor 6800! This allows you to take leaf area measurements of small or weirdly-shaped leaves (e.g. pine needles) before your measurement.

It can be installed as a progressive web app (PWA) on ios or android, so it can be used in remote field conditions.

It's close to done but not quite finished. We'll upload the 3D model for the clip soonish. Don't trust any measurements from this app unless the repo has been updated more recently than the contents of this version of the readme.
